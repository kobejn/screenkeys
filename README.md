<b>What is a Screenkey?</b><br>

Screenkey it's a button with an LCD incorporated from a company called Screenkeys, not easy to find in the consumer market since they are very expensive but very popular in big video studios and avionics.<br>
Using a tiny LCD inside a momentary button require at list a microcontroller and thanks to their miniaturization the access it's not so easy as supposed. I've managed to hack only LC16 and LC24 and they are both 6 pin devices, just 2 wires need to be individually managed.<br>
First 2 problems: they uses syncronous programming and clock needs to be constantly feeded to all devices or they get quickly damaged...<br>
Another headache it's the protocol, easy, but uses a weird parity bit that need to be constantly calculated and can be even or odd (depends of the command)<br>
The last problem it's how to manage many of these little beasts without dedicate tons of hardware and microcontroller resources.<br><br>
Taked a look around...Just one guy writed something barely usable but works only for a button, code was more an experiment and refresh frequency was so low that the key will be damaged in less than one year.<br><br>
The company has some documentation based on old microcontrollers and uses shift registers that I'm try to avoid because they easily inject interferences in audio.<br>
I got some hundreds of these keys from an auction so I decided to design something.<br>

<b>Hardware Design:</b><br>

Forget Arduino uno et similar, they simply have insufficent resources, so I choosed one
of my preferred Micro around, Teensy3.x from <b>Paul Stoffregen</b> http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3.html that it's a 32bit tiny microcontroller with a lot of features and much better supported than gigantic and expensive Arduino Due.<br>
To get around the clock problem and syncro program I choosed to use 2 clocks that can be switched automatically by microcontroller and it worked well. Then I decided to use some SPI 16bit gpio's from Microchip, the MCP23s17 that it's faster than SR and uses a unique feature called HAEN that le me share all pins between chips so only 3 pins are needed for detecting 64 switches individually and I have the data line for each switch as well. For this purpose I coded recently a library here that let me drive many of those chips. I just added a couple of buffers for the clock and a level translator for Teensy3.<br>
I choosed a refreshing clock between 500Khz to 2Mhz, a task that for Teesy3 it's pretty easy but I got the same results even if I tried to use a dedicated oscillator, just need to inform Micro at what speed I'm driving LCD's.<br>

<b>Software Design:</b><br>

Since many switches can be used I choosed to working with just one display buffer (64 bytes,512bits) that can be changed on the fly and sent to every LCD. For this reason the library has the main graphic methods that are common for every display and a child of the same library has the specific commands to inject code into display every display, this method give me also the ability to extend the display types easily. The LCD works in 'graphic' mode so text and graphic can be mixed.<br>
Graphics methods works around a pixel engine that write directly into the buffer and have rotation and origin-change capabilities, this to have the maximum flexibility if you plan to put display in vertical or you turned it upside down.<br>


<b>Experiments:</b><br>

I have tested library and hardware with 48 switches and works like a charm, it can support max 64 switches.
With 48 switches (this means 48 tiny LCD screens!!!) Teensy3 resources are used at 1 to 5%, not bad and I was right to choose the direct switch identification instead of a matrix, for the price of these switches I really need multiple key ident, not possible with matrix (oops, possibly but with several restrictions)<br>

- 500K to 3Mhz refresh clock speed.
- Access to all parameters of the LC16.
- Full system of 64 Switches needs 10 external IC's.
- Can be splitted in boards of 16 Switches.
- Can send/receive infos in I2C,RS485,Ethernet or as USB Hid/Keyboard trough Teensy3 programming.
- Interfacing with 3V3 or 5V systems.
- Identify multiple buttons pressed.

<b>FAQ:</b><br>

- Library works 'out of the box'? Just connect the switch? NO! Needs specific hardware (still not published).
- How many switches support? 64 Max.
- Can work with other Microcontrollers? Probably yes but was intended only for Teensy3.
